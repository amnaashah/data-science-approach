Dataset Description

The Water Main Breaks Dataset contains information about historical water pipe failures, including attributes such as pipe age, material, diameter, installation year, and break dates.
This project aimed to understand how aging infrastructure and environmental conditions contribute to pipeline failures.

 Data Preparation

Cleaned and standardized date/time formats and column names.

Removed missing and inconsistent values.

Analyzed trends over time, identifying peak failure periods.

key Insights

Older pipelines (over 40 years) and cast iron materials had the highest failure rates.

Seasonal variations indicated more breaks during winter months, suggesting temperature influence.

Created interactive Power BI dashboard showing failure distribution across years and materials.

Tools & Libraries

Excel for preprocessing

Python: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

Power BI for visualization and time-series trend analysis
