This repository contains the datasets and analytical work from my Bachelor’s Final Year Project (FYP), focused on exploring real-world social and environmental issues through data-driven insights.

Dataset 1 — Student Depression Analysis

The Student Depression Dataset was sourced from Kaggle and focuses on mental health conditions among students, including demographic and lifestyle variables.
It helps analyze how factors like academic pressure, sleep habits, social life, and family issues contribute to depression levels.

 Data Preparation

Cleaned using Excel (removed blanks, duplicates, formatted date/time).
Performed statistical analysis and correlation studies using Python.
Visualized data trends and relationships in Power BI dashboards.

 Key Insights

Identified strong correlations between academic stress, sleep quality, and depression levels.
Gender and year of study showed notable differences in reported stress levels.
Created a correlation heatmap and interactive dashboard showing depression distribution across demographics.

Tools & Libraries 

Excel for data cleaning
Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

Water Main Breaks Analysis
Dataset Description

The Water Main Breaks Dataset contains information about historical water pipe failures, including attributes such as pipe age, material, diameter, installation year, and break dates.
This project aimed to understand how aging infrastructure and environmental conditions contribute to pipeline failures.

 Data Preparation

Cleaned and standardized date/time formats and column names.
Removed missing and inconsistent values.
Analyzed trends over time, identifying peak failure periods.

 Key Insights

Older pipelines (over 40 years) and cast iron materials had the highest failure rates.
Seasonal variations indicated more breaks during winter months, suggesting temperature influence.
Created an interactive Power BI dashboard showing failure distribution across years and materials.

Tools & Libraries

Excel for preprocessing 
Python: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
Power BI for visualization and time-series trend analysis
